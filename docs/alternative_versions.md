# Alternative Versions

This is a list of all other versions of Future Expansion I know of.  
I'll be glad to add any others that are reported to me.

## Other Reuploads

- [@calrissian-tendra](https://github.com/calrissian-tendra)'s [reupload](https://github.com/calrissian-tendra/Future-Expansion/commits/main/), originally from 2023/07/21.
- [@EmperorPenguin](https://github.com/EmperorPinguin)'s [reupload](https://github.com/EmperorPinguin/Future-Expansion-2022-09-18), originally from 2023/09/21.
- [@Gospedius](https://github.com/Gospedius)' [fork](https://github.com/Gospedius/Sullys-Future) of EmperorPenguin's reupload.

## Modified

- [@Mr-Chubz](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz)'s [Future Edited](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz/Future-Edited), made to be compatible with [Warfare Edited](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz/Warfare-Edited).  
  Incidentally, this is the oldest extant fork of Sullien's original repo and, therefore, due to the way GitHub works, the one some reuploads (mine included) inherited as "upstream".
- [@Potatoproduction](https://github.com/Potatoproduction)'s [Future Expansion Fixed](https://github.com/Potatoproduction/Future-Expansion-Fixed).
- I've released [my modded version of the expansion](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Enhanced)! ✊🏻  
  It's a pre-release for testing, but I assume it's working fine, since the game isn't throwing any reports.  
  Feedback needed and appreciated! 🙇🏼‍♂️

## Unreleased

- In June of 2023, Sullien released [a preview of his future plans for Future Expansion](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1020909710871887913/1117652119256838155) in the form of [a RAR file containing his latest .json](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1020909710871887913/1117652118938062949/Future_Expansion_PE_TEST_BETA.rar?ex=669298e6&is=66914766&hm=dda58f07e48623897bdbcb6daa2d89c923b75a411349983117e6ab1672ba117a&).
  I've corrected a few syntax typos and [uploaded it](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Unreleased) for preservation and reference.

## Taken Down

Much like [the original mod](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion), some reuploads have been taken down, but I'm listing them below, just in case.

- [@Wheelchair](https://github.com/Wheelchair2)'s [temporary copy](https://github.com/Wheelchair2/Future-Expansion-Temporary-Copy).
- There was a reupload by [@SpacedOutChicken](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken), but I lost the URL for it.
